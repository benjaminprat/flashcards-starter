# FlashCards Terminal Trivia

## Abstract

This application was developed for a Mod2 project at the Turing School of Software and Design in Denver. The user can play a trivia game in their terminal by using their enter key and number keys to choose from a multiple choice list of answers. This application utilizes multiple classes with accompanying test files to emphasize on the importance of encapsulation, object-oriented programming (OOP), and test-driven development (TDD).
